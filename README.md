# ImageAnalysis

Code written by Nathan De Fruyt (nathan.defruyt@kuleuven.be, nathan.defruyt@gmail.com).

The ipynb folder contains jupyter notebooks in which I used the Scikit-image and opencv modules to: 
* identify spherical objects (e.g. nuclei) in 3D confocal images
* threshold objects on radius
* quantify and measure objects
* interactively annotate objects for high throughput

Consider these notebooks as inspiration on which to build your own application.
In case you are inspired, but could need some initial leads to adapt it for yourself, don't hesitate to contact me.
